            <p>The near-death experience brought new ideas to light.
                I came to realize that I was living in the past, I was thinking of the past, I was thinking of the
                future, but I was not living in the present.
                I realized that I have to be in the present moment.
                I realized that I need to appreciate the small things, not the big things.</p>

            <p>People who have had near-death experiences tend to have a more positive outlook on life.
                They tend to have a better sense of humor and they are more willing to make decisions.
                They are also more likely to give to charity.
                They also tend to be more religious, and are more likely to volunteer.
                They are also more likely to have a positive outlook on life.</p>

            <p>I came to see that I wasn't living in the moment because I was living in the past, thinking about the
                past, and planning for the future.
                I came to the conclusion that I needed to be in the now.
                I came to the conclusion that I should focus on the little things rather than the large ones.
                Near-death experience survivors typically have a more upbeat attitude on life.

                They are also more likely to be religious and to volunteer.
                Additionally, they are more prone to view life positively.</p>
