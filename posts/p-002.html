            <blockquote>His mother had always taught him not to ever think of himself as better than others.
            </blockquote>

            <p><em>He'd tried to live by this motto.</em> He never looked down on those who were less fortunate or who had less
                money than him. But the stupidity of the group of people he was talking to made him change his mind.
                A two-inch layer of freshly fallen snow covered the yard. Stacey peeked outside. To most, it would have
                been a beautiful sight worthy of taking a photo to put on Instagram. For Stacey, it meant something
                different. The first snow of the year brought back the witches as the fairies in the yard had to seek
                shelter to avoid the cold.
                I checked in for the night at Out O The Way motel. What a bad choice that was.</p>

            <p><b>First I took a shower and a spider crawled out of the drain.</b> Next, the towel rack fell down when I
                reached for the one small bath towel. This allowed the towel to fall halfway into the toilet. I tried to
                watch a movie, but the remote control was sticky and wouldn’t stop scrolling through the channels. I
                gave up for the night and crawled into bed. I stretched out my leg and felt something furry by my foot.
                Filled with fear, I reached down and to my surprise, I pulled out a raccoon skin pair of underwear.
                After my initial relief that it wasn’t alive, the image of a fat, ugly businessman wearing raccoon skin
                briefs filled my brain. I jumped out of the bed, threw my toothbrush into my bag, and sprinted towards
                my car.
                Balloons are pretty and come in different colors, different shapes, different sizes, and they can even
                adjust sizes as needed. But don't make them too big or they might just pop, and then bye-bye balloon.
                It'll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind. They can serve a variety of purposes, from decorating to
                water balloon wars. You just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them.
                She needed glasses. It wasn't that she couldn't see without them, but what she could see with them. When
                she wore glasses, her eyes focused so deeply that she could see not only the physical but also beyond.
                It was like a superpower. But she needed glasses.
                It wasn't supposed to end that way.</p>

            <p><u>The plan had been meticulously thought out and practiced again and again.</u> There was only one possible
                result once it had been implemented, but as they stood there the result wasn't anything close to what it
                should have been. They all blankly looked at each wondering how this could have happened. In their
                minds, they all began to blame the other members of the group as to why they had failed.
                She sat down with her notebook in her hand, her mind wandering to faraway places. She paused and
                considered all that had happened. It hadn't gone as expected. When the day began she thought it was
                going to be a bad one, but as she sat recalling the day's events to write them down, she had to admit,
                it had been a rather marvelous day.
                There was something in the tree. It was difficult to tell from the ground, but Rachael could see
                movement. She squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement, trying to decipher exactly
                what she had spied. The more she peered, however, the more she thought it might be a figment of her
                imagination. Nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree. Then in
                the corner of her eye, she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again.
                Have you ever wondered about toes? Why 10 toes and not 12. Why are some bigger than others? Some people
                can use their toes to pick up things while others can barely move them on command. Some toes are nice to
                look at while others are definitely not something you want to look at. Toes can be stubbed and make us
                scream. Toes help us balance and walk. 10 toes are just something to ponder.
                Where do they get a random paragraph?" he wondered as he clicked the generate button. </p>
            <p>Do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere? At that moment he read the random
                paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same.
                It really didn't matter what they did to him. He's already made up his mind. Whatever came his way, he
                was prepared for the consequences. He knew in his heart that the sacrifice he made was done with love
                and not hate no matter how others decided to spin it.
                Pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field. Cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river
                meandered off to the side. What looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy. Everything
                in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth.
